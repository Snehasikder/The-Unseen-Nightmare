### ☁️ About This Project
*The Unseen Nightmare* is a creative experiment exploring storytelling through design. It’s not a horror story in the traditional sense — instead, it plays with **atmosphere, disorientation, and memory**, conveyed through gentle, immersive visuals and layered narrative elements. Think of it as a psychological dream rendered in code.
