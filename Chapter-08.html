     I realized that the way I thought things was wrong. Things were much more complex to think
     them simply. And without considering the other sides, I made decisions which backfired me.

     As the walls started to come close and the door began to close, I felt that if the doors got closed,
     I won’t be able to return no matter what I do.

     I ran hard and came back to the first room. I still don’t know whether I did the right thing or wrong.
     My leg is hurting like hell. The door to the second room is closed.

     At this moment, I don’t know what should I do.
     I felt shattered inside. I didn’t understand how but things were taking a toll on me. Though I didn’t
     realize but little by little all the things that happened made me emotionally weak. 

     I reminded myself again that I have to survive…….

     I looked at the map and went to the place where the statue is supposed to be. I stood at the exact 
     place. I kept the map also at the designated place. Only then I notice that there was a very statue
     like button on the was below the map.
     I pressed it.

     And for the third time I fell as the middle of the floor broke down and I was taken to a new place.
     I thought my leg would be broken this time for sure. But surprisingly the total opposite thing happened. 
     My leg got healed.
     As I arrived at that place, I heard the eerie voice again after such a long time. 

     “VICTORY!!! CONGRATULATION ON COMPLETING THE GAME!!”

     HUH????? How did it happen?? Wait..I won? That easily? You are lying otherwise I wouldn’t have been
     stuck in the game.

     “HELLO, THIS IS THE CHIEF PROGRAMMER OF OG STUDIO. WE ARE TRULY SORRY, MISS. YOU WERE STUCK DUE TO
     THE BUG OUR PROGRAMMERS RECENTLY FACED. IT WAS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU”

     What…bug? That means I am free now? 

     “YES, YOU ARE FREE MISS. NOW IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MORE YOU CAN OR YOU COULD CHOOSE TO EXIT.”
     I exit…I mean I choose to exit. But one question if I didn’t go back to the first room, would I be
     able to win and go back like now? 

     “NO, MISS. THE VICTORY BUTTON IS THE ONE YOU HAVE PRESSED AND THAT’S THE ONLY ONE.”
     Then if I had not gone back to the first room and stayed in the second room, then?

     “WELL, MISS THAT’S HARD TO SAY. ANYWAYS THANKS FOR PLAYING OUR GAME YOU WILL BE NOW EXITED”
     I opened my eyes. The room was bright unlike the ones in the game. Everyone asked me if I was okay 
     or not. I said I was fine. But the day I spent there was none other than my unseen nightmare.
            
                                                                                    TO BE CONTINUED……………………
