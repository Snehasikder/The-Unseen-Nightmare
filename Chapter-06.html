     I can still feel the pain in my leg. The pain is so bad that I feel like cutting my leg off.
     It got worse since I ran. But I have to keep moving even if I die here. At least, I won’t have
     any regrets left. I opened the door.

     As I entered the place, I noticed that there was number of doors. Which almost reminded 
     me of a maze, but not exactly a maze. I kept feeling that I know what that is, but I couldn’t
     remember. 

     I started thinking which door should I take. Each step became crucial for me. I felt that the 
     heaviness of my helpless desire started consuming me. But it didn’t take me long to understand 
     what that place is-------

     Is it a treasure hunt? Yeah, it is a treasure hunting place. A place where clues are kept in the 
     surrounding things from which you have to retrieve the key to the tightly sealed lock of the door
     and open it. But as the level rises and you get closer to your victory, the harder the games get.

     So, no matter which door I choose it won’t be a problem for me to find the way to triumph as long as
     I don’t mess up with the clues. Without hesitation, I choose the door that was front of me.

     As I opened the door, I noticed that the room was a darkish grey colored room. To be honest, 
     I didn’t expect it to be some bright colored room as it was a horror vr game to be honest.
     But honestly, they are going to give a heart attack to the guy who comes to play this vr game.  
     The reason why I said this is because how creepy this room is filled with dust, dried blood and 
     skeletons.

     But I don’t have the time to complain about how bad the room is. My main goal now is to survive. So,
     I started looking around the place for some clues.

     There was a photo frame, a map, an almirah, quite a number of bones, dried blood and a door which is
     tightly sealed with a lock. I first opened the almirah and found nothing but dust. Then I looked the
     map. There was a lot of places marked. But my eyes got hooked as I saw a statue like person looking 
     at the map of a room. I noticed that the room was quite similar to mine. 

     I took the map as I thought it would help me in the future. I took the photo frame and throw it to 
     the wall. The picture broke and key was exposed. Though it was a reckless move I accept, I did it.
     Because that’s how detectives work in the movies. And surprisingly, it works. 

     I quickly opened the door and as I thought I was taken to another room like before.
