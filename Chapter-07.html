But I felt slightly confident and happy that I was doing ok.

The first thing I noticed was when I came to this room, that this room had a very distinct smell.
The smell of blood. It felt so awful that I had to cover my mouth as soon as I arrived.

The room was covered with red light. I felt the room was mostly dark with only red bulb emitting 
light.

The combination of the light and the smell made me felt as it was a crime scene. More like 
a serial killers secret place. Where he does the gruesome work.

And once again I was right.

There was body in front of me. Which I presumed was dead. To confirm it, I got closer to the body.
The floor was drenched with dried blood. The room had nothing else. It was a very small place. 
Like only five medium sized people could fit in the room. The body was of a man. Who had died by
knife stabbing. As the knife was used for stabbing was still inside his chest.

But the problem is where can I find the key? Don’t say…d-do I have to touch the bodyyy?????

I looked around the place but there was no clue. I realized at that moment that this was not a
treasure hunt that I was thinking of. Because in that treasure hunt number of clues are hidden
and without solving that you can never find the key so easily let alone to open the door. 

Then what kind of treasure hunt is this?? Wait is this even a treasure hunt?? Maybe it was sort of 
close to the treasure hunt. But what if its not? 

At that moment I take out the map I brought with me from the room before. I saw that the statue in
front of the map was still there. I thought the map would be like a gps and the statue was me.
But if its not then……did I miss something?

At that moment the walls started to come closer to me and the door began to close. I ran there like
I was running for my life ignoring the pain in my leg. But my sleeve got stuck in the door as it closed. 
Without having any choice, I had to tear it. 
I came back to the first room.

Back to square one! Huhh………
