 Have you ever felt lonely and scared, wondering what would happen if everything in the
 world disappeared except you? There would be no one to rely on but yourself. If someone
 had told me this before, I would have laughed it off, thinking it was impossible. But
 not now. It has been 2 hours, 14 minutes, and 59 seconds since I began something I 
 shouldn't have. The world hasn’t disappeared, nor have the humans or anything else. 
 The one who disappeared was me… into a VR game.
            
 I’m Alexi, a sci-fi and horror enthusiast who loves exploring new things and games. My
 life was going well until a project I worked so hard on placed second. The winner 
 celebrated, even the third place was delighted, but I couldn’t smile no matter what. 
 People congratulated them and some expressed sympathy to me, but none could understand
 what I was going through. I had worked for months on that project, and the feeling of 
 losing and regret consumed me.
            
 While looking for a distraction, I came across the news of my favorite studio’s new VR 
 adventure game seeking beta testers. Without hesitation, I signed up. Arriving at the 
 testing site, I met the creators of my favorite games. I told them how much I 
 appreciated their work. After talking with them, they asked me about my feelings 
 regarding the VR game I came to test today. I said that I was really excited as it
 was my first time being a beta tester; the feeling of trying a game before its release
 was indescribable. After signing the confidentiality paper, a person took me to the 
 testing room.
            
 The testing room was cold, the kind of cold that made my skin prickle. The headset in my
 hands felt heavy with the weight of unknown possibilities. As I slipped it over my 
 head, a shiver ran down my spine. All my excitement soon turned into my worst nightmare
 as I put on the device. Sweat began to pour down my face. When I tried to remove the
 gadget, a sinister and creepy voice said,
            
 "The game has started… Live if you can."
            
 I thought it was a joke. Now I am trapped.
