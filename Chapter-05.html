     How ironic it is!
                    
     I couldn’t help but laugh as I started thinking. Is it really the end? 
     Can I even reach the door before all the insects come and devour me?
                    
     I shook off the negative thoughts. I started mumbling nonstop:
                    
     "I need to survive. I need to survive. I need to survive."
                    
     I took a deep breath. [Inhale and Exhale]
                    
     I swore to myself it's now or never. I don’t know how, but I felt as if I was
      given an instant energy boost at that very moment. And I quickly ran over to 
      the door just before it closed.  
                    
     I finally realized what the proverb meant by , “If you have will, there’s a way.” 
     I never thought I could even walk with that much pain but I ran over.
      Humans are truly a piece of work. 
                    
     As I reached, I saw an unknown place. But it didn’t take long for me to understand. 
     I realized at that moment what was waiting for me ahead.
