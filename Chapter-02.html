     After hearing that voice, I felt nauseous and passed out. When I woke up, I felt a sharp 
     pain in my head. Slowly, my memories started coming back. I realized I wasn’t dreaming;
     I was trapped in this game. The place I woke up in was covered in darkness, with only 
     two visible lights. Each of these lights came from two black doors.
                    
     As I got closer to the doors, I saw the words “CHOOSE YOUR PATH, CHOOSE YOUR FUTURE”
     written in bold red letters above them. One door led to a scene of icy-crystal storms,
     while the other opened to a landscape of volcanic eruptions and magma-covered floors.
                    
     No matter which path I chose, I would end up dead.
                    
     Why am I stuck here? This was supposed to be a VR game, wasn’t it? Is this how I’ll die?
     Why is this happening to me? What should I do?
                    
     I asked myself over and over-
                    
     I can’t die. I won’t die. No matter what, I’ll survive. This isn’t the time to panic; I
     need to think of a solution. 
                    
     Then I remembered something someone once told me: “If you can’t find a way, create one.”
     I started examining my surroundings, hoping to find another way out. I didn't think they
     would be foolish enough to leave only these two doors as options. Maybe this was a mind
     game. I thought optimistically as I continued to look around.
                    
     I started to scan the room desperately, my heart pounding heavily in my chest. The walls 
     seemed to close in on me, shadows dancing menacingly in the faint light. Then, almost
     hidden behind a thick curtain of darkness, I saw it—a third, barely visible black door.
     A bright light shone through. I stepped into the light, thinking I had won, without 
     considering what might be waiting for me ahead.
