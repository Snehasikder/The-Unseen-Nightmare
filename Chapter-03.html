     Stepping through the door, my triumph dissolved as a sinister voice shattered my 
     illusions. It warned, "THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. FAIL TO COMPLETE THE GAME IN
     TIME, YOU’LL BE LOST HERE FOREVER.”  Glancing at my watch, I realized only 54 
     minutes had passed. The headset covering my face meant I was unconscious—how 
     would I eat? People can survive without food for three days, some even longer. 
     Could I endure that long? Urgency gripped me; I needed to escape. Lost in thought,
     I stumbled upon a colossal maze that loomed ahead, the guiding light now extinguished.

           "Holy moly! I've never seen such a massive maze."

           "YOUR TIME HAS BEGUN" blared the ominous message before the maze.

           "Excellent work, Alexi! Everyone should learn how to complicate their lives from you!"

     Beside self-cursing, I grappled with indecision. Which path should I take? What if 
     there's no turning back? Would I perish before finding an exit? Despair threatened 
     to overwhelm me.
                    
     "Wait... Why panic? Who am I? I am Alexi. Instead of blaming myself, I must focus on 
     action. Some things can't change. What's the plan? Can I feel my body? Yes. Can I use
     the thread from my sweater? Yes, I can tear it. Let's see what I can do."
                    
     Surveying the maze, I spotted tree branches nearby—potential clues. Gathering them, I
     teared a bit of thread and tied the branches together. Without much hesitation, I
     chose the second path from the left and ventured into the maze, marking my progress
     with branches.
                    
     As I continued to explore, each step felt heavier, the path seemingly endless. 
     Yet, I reassured myself, "I'm getting closer. Just a bit more. Just a bit more."
     Finally, I reached another imposing black door.
     
     Checking my watch, I completed the task in 1 hour and 12 minutes, totaling 2 hours and 6 minutes
     since my arrival. The second challenge was less exhausting and easier but left me uneasy. Opening
     the door, I was pulled through like a magnet, the door slamming shut behind me. What’s 
     the thing that was waiting for me ahead? Is it the end or it’s just the beginning of 
     something?
