     Panic seized me as I rushed to the door, finding it tightly sealed. My heart started
      pounding heavily, sweat slick on my palms, the eerie voice returned.
     "CONGRATS! NOW YOU'VE ENTERED THE REAL GAME. BUT IF YOU CAN'T COMPLETE THE GAME IN TIME,
      YOU'LL BE TRAPPED HERE FOREVER. BUT THINGS WON'T BE AS EASY AS BEFORE."
                
     "What do you mean? You can't just leave me in the dark!"
                
     "YOU'LL UNDERSTAND AS YOU PROGRESS. BEST OF LUCK!"
                
     After hearing that, I felt the ground shaking. Soon, the ground broke from the middle and
      I fell from there.
                
     As I fell, I thought I died. But I survived. I sprained my right leg. It felt as if it had 
     broken. I felt so miserable when I wasn’t even able to move. It wasn’t my real body to begin
     with, but I felt exactly as if it was really happening to me. 
                
     My thoughts didn’t last long; the place I fell was again shaking heavily. Some insects were 
     coming, and the floor was filled with them. Rocks were falling from above. As I was lost in 
     thought, I saw a black door again, but the sprain was so painful that I couldn’t even move 
     around, and moreover, the insects were crawling on the floor.

     The black door was closing bit by bit. I realized at that moment that if the door is closed then 
     I would not be able to return no matter what I do. At that moment I looked at my watch. It was
     exactly 2 hours 14 minutes and 59 seconds since my arrival. I started feeling extremely anxious.

     I felt the world without me will move perfectly fine. Would anyone even think about me if I die in
     this place? I began something I shouldn't have. The world hasn’t disappeared, nor have the humans 
     or anything else. The one who disappeared was me… into a VR game. The reality was still hard to 
     accept.
